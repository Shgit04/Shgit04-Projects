Project Title: Sentiment Analysis Dashboard for Global News

This project combines data analytics, machine learning, and visualization to create a tool that analyzes the sentiment of news articles from around the world in real time.

Steps to Get Started

	1. Data Collection:
		o Use APIs like Google News, Bing News Search, or other public news APIs to fetch real-time news articles.
		o Preprocess the data to extract titles, summaries, publication dates, and regions.
	2. Data Cleaning and Preparation with PySpark:
		o Load the collected data into a Spark DataFrame in Fabric.
		o Perform data cleaning, such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and normalizing text data.
	3. Sentiment Analysis:
		o Use a pre-trained natural language processing (NLP) model (e.g., TextBlob or VADER) to perform sentiment analysis on the text data.
		o Score each article as positive, neutral, or negative and calculate an aggregate sentiment score for regions or topics.
	4. Data Storage:
		o Store the processed data and sentiment scores in an Azure SQL Database for persistent storage and querying.
	5. Visualization:
		o Use Fabric's built-in visualization tools or integrate the data with Power BI.
		o Create interactive dashboards to display:
			* Daily Trends in Sentiment scores over time.
			* Top 10 most frequently occurring keywords in the "titles" column.

Why It's Interesting
	* Combines real-time data processing with machine learning and visualization.
	* Offers actionable insights into global trends and public sentiment.
	* Scalable to handle data from various sources and regions.
